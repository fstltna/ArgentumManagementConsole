Edit "amc" and change the settings at the top if your Argentum server is not in /home/argentumowner/anura.

You will need to run cpan and install these modules:

- cpan -i UI::Dialog
- cpan -i Term::ReadKey
- cpan -i Term::ANSIScreen
- cpan -i Proc::ProcessTable

You also need to have my Argentum Age Startup Scripts and Backup Scripts installed.

I suggest you add this directory to your PATH variable so you can run this script directly and can update it and use the new version easily.
